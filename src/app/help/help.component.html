        <h2>Manual</h2>
        <p>
            ScripDraft is a plain text editor with a robust undo/redo system loosely inspired by Git. (It's OK if you have never heard of Git.)
        </p>

        <p>
            Whenever you click "commit", it creates a kind of save point or a version of your text at that point. You can create these save points at any time while drafting your text with some simple exceptions. We do try to keep you from accidentally clicking "commit" twice and saving the same text twice.
        </p>

        <p>
            After you have created these save points ("commits"), you can review them, clicking the "back" button to see the previous commit or "forward" to view the next commit. Of course, these buttons only apply if there <em>is</em> a previous or a <em>next</em> commit. There would only be a "next" commit if you are currently viewing a past/previous commit.
        </p>

        <h3>Editing from a Commit</h3>

        <p>
            Much like the traditional undo/redo of a text editing application, if you go back and then edit, then you have lost any ability to go "forward" again. Translated into the terms of this app, if you browse backward to a previous commit and then edit that commit
